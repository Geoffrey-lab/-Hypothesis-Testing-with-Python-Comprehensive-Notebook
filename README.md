# Hypothesis Testing with Python: Comprehensive Notebook

This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter notebook dedicated to hypothesis testing in Python, offering a thorough introduction to various statistical tests and concepts. This resource is designed for data scientists, statisticians, and anyone interested in understanding the fundamental principles of hypothesis testing through practical examples and visualizations.

## Repository Contents

### Notebook Overview
The notebook is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of hypothesis testing:

1. **Introduction to Hypothesis Testing**
   - Overview of hypothesis testing
   - Importance and applications in data science

2. **Probability and Distribution Plotting**
   - Calculating probabilities using the normal distribution
   - Plotting probability density functions (PDF)
   - Example: Probability of a random data scientist's height being 1.5 meters

3. **One-Sided vs. Two-Sided Hypothesis Tests**
   - Explanation of one-sided and two-sided tests
   - Visual representation of hypothesis bounds
   - Example: Testing significance points with standard normal distribution

4. **Type I and Type II Errors**
   - Understanding false positives (Type I errors) and false negatives (Type II errors)

5. **Testing Equality of Means with Known Population Variance**
   - Comparing two sample means
   - Calculating the Z-statistic
   - Example: Comparing sample means with known variances

6. **t-Distribution and Sample Variance**
   - Introduction to the t-distribution
   - Calculating sample variance and degrees of freedom
   - Example: Hypothesis testing with the t-distribution

7. **Equality of Means with Unknown Population Variance**
   - Using the t-distribution for comparing means with unknown variances
   - Pooled variance estimation
   - Example: Testing equality of means with unknown variances

8. **F-Distribution for Testing Equality of Variances**
   - Introduction to the F-distribution
   - Testing for equality of variances
   - Example: Visualizing the F-distribution and performing variance tests

9. **Chi-Squared Distribution for Goodness of Fit and Categorical Data**
   - Applying the chi-squared distribution for goodness of fit tests
   - Example: Factory dingbat rejection rates
   - Example: Testing independence in a contingency table (left-handedness and smoking)

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Each section includes detailed examples with step-by-step explanations and visualizations.
- **Visualizations**: The notebook uses Matplotlib to create clear and informative plots for various distributions and test results.
- **Code Snippets**: Practical code snippets demonstrate how to perform different hypothesis tests using SciPy and NumPy.
